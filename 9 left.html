    <h1>The Art Of War by Sun Tzu</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1.2 -The Text of Sun Tzu</h2>
    <p>
      I have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tzu’s text. 
      The quo- tations that occur in early authors go to show that the "13 chapters" 
      of which Ssu-ma Ch‘ien speaks were essentially the same as those now extant. 
      We have his word for it that they were widely circulated in his day, and can only 
      regret that he refrained from discussing them on that account. Sun Hsing-yen says in his preface:

      <p style="padding:10px;">During the Ch‘in and Han dynasties Sun Tzu’s ART OF WAR was in general use 
        amongst military commanders, but they seem to have treated it as a work of mysterious import, 
        and were unwilling to expound it for the benefit of posterity. Thus it came about that Wei Wu was 
        the first to write a commentary on it.</p>
